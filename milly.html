<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF"> Isn't this so nice? To have the whole family together for New Years Eve?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF"> I nearly didn't make it, couldn't get my hoverjet started<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF">I told you not to buy one of those cheap Martian ones<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF"> Yeh I know but I got a good deal on it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF"> Not a very good deal if it won't start<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF"> Martian workmanship has declined in the last the 20 years, since they became a communist planet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF">I disagree I think it has improved<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it has in some ways<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF"> Rubbish, they've gone to pieces<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF"> Now, now, it's New Years Eve so let's all be nice to each other<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF">What do we have for dinner Bot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I don't know I haven't thought about it yet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF">You are a robot, you shouldn't have to think about it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot</font color="#0000FF"> (to himself) Brain the size of a universe and all I do is decide what to get for dinner.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF">Can you imagine all those years ago when people had to cook their own dinners ( they all laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF">(quietly) Oh, those were the days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF"> I can't even imagine how they did that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF"> I can<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF"> And all those funny things that they had to eat, like rice and potatoes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF"> Must have taken all night to eat a meal<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF"> Give me a nice red pill any day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, me too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> While we are gathered here I would like to share some exciting news with you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> Oooo this sounds good what can it be<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Excellent, I like a bit of excitement<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> Come on then. What is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Don't keep us in suspense Kirsty, what's the news<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  Well, here it is then – I am expecting a baby<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh wonderful!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> Well that IS exciting news<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Congratulations Kirsty<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, congrats. When is it due?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> Fedex are delivering it next Thursday<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh so soon. That's good. When did you order it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  Just two weeks ago<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Very good service then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> I am sure you will make a wonderful mother my dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF"> Thank you mum<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Fedex are very reliable for deliveries<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, You were a week late Pru<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> How awful mum, it must have been agony just sitting there waiting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> I feel for you. That's all I seem to do is stand here waiting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  You came from UPS Pru. We swore we would never use them again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I wasn't delivered mum was I?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  No, we picked you up from the cash and carry. You used to be able to that in those days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> Have you got a name for it yet Kirsty?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> Not yet. Plenty of time though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Quite right. Choose a good name as they will have it for the rest of their lives.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Well,. I have some exciting news too!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> All this excitement – it's so depressing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> Come on then Jed, what's your news<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I have just got a new job<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> Congratulations son!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> You always were a clever boy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  What's the Job Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, tell us all about it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok, I am going to be a heart surgeon<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh goodness, that sounds very exciting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> A big change from being a deep sea diver<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> He never went into the sea, the robots did<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> There is a lot of training of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Of course. How long?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Nearly 25 minutes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot</font color="#0000FF">  (sarcastically). Oh my gosh, so long<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh you poor dear. I am sure you will get through it though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  So will you actually be operating on hearts then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> As if<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Not quite. The robots do most of the work – I have to push the start button though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  What are the working hours like Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Not too bad, start at eleven and finish at one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> Not bad at all then, what about salary?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Only 4 million a month to start but an increase if I do well<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Good luck with that Jed, I hope it goes well<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  How exciting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Dinner is ready!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Ahh thank you bot<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  He's a good Robot really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Here you are everybody, help yourself to a food pill<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh No!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  What's the matter Pru?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  I forgot to mention to Bot – I am a reditarian now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Reditarian? What on Earth is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> It means I don't eat red pills any more<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Why is that Pru<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  I know why<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  It is a new movement. People have stopped eating red pills because red is it is the colour associated with Mars. Their national flag<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes, I read about that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Is it because of the way they treat their robots?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, it damn well is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Exactly. They have to be stopped<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Apparently they are treating them just like humans<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, and that is the last thing we want. We deserve to be treated a bit better than that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  So may I have a blue pill please Bot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  I suppose so. Do you want gravy with that ?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes please<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  Maybe we should all go reditarian<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Not me, I enjoy my red pills too much<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Your mother and I have some news too, although not particularly exciting.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> What's that dad?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  It is something we have been thinking about for a while now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  And we thought with the New Millennium dawning perhaps now is the time to make the change<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> What change?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, what is it <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  ( There is a short pause) Well – your mother and I – and we both agreed to this – it was a joint decision – something we felt we wanted to change<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  WHAT !<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  What your dad is trying to say is....<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  We have decided to start wearing clothes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  Clothes??? Mum, dad, You are going to be clothists?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Why? Clothes are dirty and unhygienic and they look disgusting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I am not sure that is a good idea. People will laugh at you if they see you walking about in clothes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> We know it won't be easy but it is something we have come to believe in, that people should be clothed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Seems a bit of a crazy idea to me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too. I think you should consider this very carefully<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh we have. We know it won't make us popular<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> We don't care about that though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  It is going to be really weird coming to dinner here and neither of you are naked<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  I am sure you will get used to it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  And where will you get the clothes from<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  There are places<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  There is a tiny little island called Hong Kong. Apparently it is still possible to buy some there.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> I can't imagine ever wearing clothes. I mean I have seen some pictures, you know in those rather unsavoury magazines. I could never do it myself though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  It made some sense before the glass dome covered us and people needed to keep warm<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Since there is now a constant 25 degree temperature there really is no need for clothes. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  We are getting older now and I suppose we are starting to think in a different way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh mum, you are not old<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> We are getting on though. I shall be 180 next year<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  I'll be 439<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> That's no age at all mum these days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, and look at dad, 212 and fit as a fiddle<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Well we decided and that is that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> With all this excitement we mustn't forget the new year. What time is it Bot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Brain the size of a universe and what do they get me to do? Tell them what the time is Tcchhhh – It's 11.45<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> 15 minutes to go to the year 3000<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  It seems like we have all had some news except you Pru<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Not much new in my life, except I am taking a trip next week<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> Where are you off to Pru?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  It's a kind of an educational trip<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Booooooorrringgg<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  It is not boring Bot. I happen to be very interested in history<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> I can give you over 400 years of it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> I want to go back much, much further than that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  So where are you going to Pru<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> A place you have probably never heard of<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  What's it called?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> It has a very strange name and only a few people today have visited it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Maybe there is a reason for that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> It's called ( She says this slowly) New – York – City<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> I have heard of it. Many years ago, when I was at school,  we did a project on it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> Never heard of it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  I have. It is the remains of a very ancient city<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> Can't say I have ever heard of it either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  I have, but then I have heard of everything because I have a brain the size of a universe. Is there something I can do for you? Like close the door?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Shut up Bot you are always complaining<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Impossible, I am not programmed to complain.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  You must have a chip loose then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Don't worry about me. I'll just sit here quietly. Just pretend I don't exist. Been like that for most of my life anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Just ignore him, he's alright<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  So is there a purpose to this trip Pru?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes, indeed. What used to be a city is now a giant museum and we can see how our ancestors lived many years ago<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> That sounds interesting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I have heard it is so fascinating, we can learn about the habits and their lifestyle and their difficulties<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> I bet they had many difficulties in those does.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok, just listen to this! In those times they had  -  HAIR!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh really? Where did they have it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I read about this too, They had it all over but mostly on their heads<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  On their heads????<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, and no matter how short they had it cut, it will still keep growing<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Can you imagine how strange that would be? To have hair on the top of your head.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Well you are going to start wearing clothes mum maybe that will be the next step for you and dad Ha ha<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Don't talk such nonsense<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> If anyone is interested in what I say, it is five to twelve<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Thank you Bot. How exciting. A new millennium<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  I wonder what they did at the last one? The year 2000<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Ah I have read about that too. Apparently  in those days they used to have a drink called alcohol<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Alcohol? What on Earth is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> People used to drink it and it would make them  - ehh, I can't remember what it is called now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> It's called DRUNK!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Is it indeed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> They would have this drink and it could affect them in all sorts of ways. They may get argumentative, of abusive or giggly or even fall over. I think a lot of that was drunk at the last millennium<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh dear. And they were forced to drink it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh no! They chose to drink it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> How very strange our ancestors were<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, thank goodness we don't live in those times.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob: </font color="#0000FF"> It will soon be time to welcome in the new year. The year 3000<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> I wonder what it will be like at the next millennium?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Who knows? Many changes I expect<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha: </font color="#0000FF"> How could life be any better than this?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty: </font color="#0000FF"> You are right mum, how could it be more perfect.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  30 seconds to go!<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok everyone, this is it The New Millennium<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru: </font color="#0000FF"> Lets all hold hands as the new year comes in<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Good idea<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh sorry about this folks<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob:</font color="#0000FF">  What's the matter Bot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot:</font color="#0000FF">  Hmmm rather embarrassing really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Here I am, a brain the size of a planet. And I have got the time wrong<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jed</font color="#0000FF">  Oh no Bot, do you mean we have missed it<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Bot: </font color="#0000FF"> Well actually I am quite a way out. The year 3000 is actually next year<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jacob.</font color="#0000FF"> Oh Bot!!! how could you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Martha:</font color="#0000FF">  Never mind, it is still new year and we can do the same thing again next year<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  I can hear bells ringing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kirsty:</font color="#0000FF">  So can I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pru:</font color="#0000FF">  Me too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes I hear them<p>
